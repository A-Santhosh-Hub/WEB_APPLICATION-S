The Server, in this idea is we don't need to upload the one single server, If this online you Mobile as Server If you selected Folder 📁 , you need only the data only watch and Download, no need to upload .

Like I can see the my friend server and my friend see my server, if my friend online and selected Folder.

P2P Mobile Folder Server (No Upload, Direct Sharing System)
Core Concept
Build a peer-to-peer folder sharing system where:
Each user’s mobile device acts as a temporary server
No cloud storage is used
No file upload is required
Files are transferred directly from device to device
Folder is accessible only while the owner is online
This system should work similar to a personal live file server.
Main Objective
Create a web-based or app-based system where:
User selects a folder
System generates a Share ID or link
Friend enters the ID
Friend sees folder contents
Friend can view or download files
When owner goes offline, access stops automatically
Core Technology Requirements
Primary Technology
Use WebRTC for direct device-to-device connection.
Supporting Components
Signaling server (Node.js)
WebSocket or Socket.io
HTML, CSS, JavaScript frontend
Mobile-friendly UI
System Architecture
Flow
Host (Folder Owner):
Opens app
Selects folder
App generates Share ID
App waits for connection
Viewer (Friend):
Opens app
Enters Share ID
Connects to host
Sees folder contents
Downloads files directly from host
Required Features
1. Host Mode
Select folder from device
Display:
Folder name
Number of files
Total size
Generate:
Share ID
Share link
Start/stop sharing button
Show connected users
2. Viewer Mode
Enter Share ID
Connect to host
View folder structure
File list with:
Name
Size
Type icon
Download button
Media preview:
Images
Videos
Audio
PDFs
3. Real-Time Behavior
Works only while host is online
Auto disconnect if host closes app
Live connection status
4. Security Features
Random Share ID (6–8 characters)
Optional:
Password protection
End-to-end encrypted transfer (WebRTC default)
5. Performance Requirements
Direct P2P transfer
No server storage
Chunked file transfer for large files
Resume support (if possible)
UI/UX Requirements
Design Style
Modern 2025 style
Minimal, clean interface
Mobile-first design
Smooth animations
Main Screens
Home Screen
Two buttons:
“Share Folder”
“Connect to Friend”
Host Screen
Folder details
Share ID display
Copy link button
Start/Stop sharing
Viewer Screen
Enter Share ID
File browser view
Download buttons
Technical Stack
Frontend
HTML5
CSS3
Vanilla JavaScript (or React if preferred)
Backend (Signaling Only)
Node.js
Express
Socket.io
Core Protocol
WebRTC Data Channels
Folder Access Approach
Web Version (Browser)
Use:
File System Access API
User selects folder manually
No background access
Mobile App Version (Future)
Use native file system access
Run local WebRTC server
Development Phases
Phase 1: Basic P2P Connection
Share ID generation
Device connection
Text message exchange
Phase 2: File Transfer
Single file transfer
Download support
Phase 3: Folder Sharing
Folder listing
Multiple files
Media preview
Phase 4: UI Polish
Animations
Mobile optimization
Dark mode
Optional Advanced Features
QR code for Share ID
Multiple viewers at once
Download progress bars
File search
Temporary session history
Technical Constraints
No cloud file storage
No permanent uploads
Must work in modern browsers
Must work on mobile devices
Deliverables
Working web app (host + viewer)
Signaling server
Deployment instructions
Mobile-friendly UI
Source code with comments
End Goal
A system where:
“Any phone can become a temporary online file server, and friends can access it directly without uploads or cloud storage.”
